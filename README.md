# Social Media App

### A simple social media web app built in React for the front-end that lets a user create an account, create/edit/delete posts, and follow other users as well as be able to chat with them.

### The app connects to a back-end API (written in mostly in Node.js) to communicate or send data to and from a MongoDB Atlas server.

### Some common tools and concepts used for this app include things like:
#### * useReducer (immer package) for handling the bulk of the logic in various React components
#### * react router (switch/routes/withRouter etc.)
#### * client-side routing & validation (i.e. when signing up or signing in)
#### * flash messages
#### * using tokens (for the back-end to trust the app which is set to expire after 24hrs)
#### * react tool tip
#### * react markdown
#### * suspense (or lazy loading) for performance reasons when hosting the app live
#### * css Bootstrap for button, colors (i.e. flash messages as mentioned) 
#### * css transistion group (animations)

### A quick preview in the form of screenshots can be seen below:
